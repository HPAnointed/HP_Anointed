  <h3>Domain Name Server (DNS) is a standard protocol that helps Internet users discover websites using human
  readable addresses. Like a phonebook which lets you look up the name of a person and discover their number,
  DNS lets you type the address of a website and automatically discover the Internet Protocol (IP) address for that
  website. It is the system that is used to translate human-memorable domain names like namecheap.com and
  hostnames like support.namecheap.com into the corresponding numeric Internet Protocol (IP) addresses as well
  as to identify and locate computer systems and resources on the Internet.
  without (dns) the internet will collapse

   <h3><center><br>Different type of domains available</br></center></h3>
   <h4>there are five different types of domains available to you. Some won’t be available to you unless you’re
   running a particular kind of website.
   <ol>
     <li>Top level domains </li>
     <li>Country Code Top Level Domains</li>
     <li>Generic Top-Level Domains</li>
     <li>Second-Level Domains</li>
     <li>Third Level Domains</li>
   </ol>
   
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Top level domains</li>
      
      Are at the top of the internet hierarchy of domain names. You’ll see these commonly referred
      to as TLDs. There are over thousands of different TLDs available. In recent years ICANN opened up new TLD
      registration and approval, so companies and individuals could pitch and register unique TLDs. This sent the
      number of TLDs available soaring. examples of TLDs are (.com, .website, .info, .org)
     <br><br>
     <li>Country Code Top-level domains</li>
     these are technically tied to different countries. Each country has its own ccTLD, but you don’t have to use one, just because you live in a specific country.
     For example,the ccTLD.co is technically for websites based out of Colombia.
     These domain extensions can be useful if you’re building a website in a specific country and want to signal to your visitors that they’ve come to the right place. For example, websites based out of the US can use the ‘.us’ extension,while companies from Japan can use the ‘.jp’ extension.
  <br><br>
  <li>Generic Top-level domains</li>
  This is more of a definition than an actual type of domain. As the description suggests, it’s just a different variation of a TLD. So, you could technically classify this type of domain as a TLD as well.
A lot of gTLDs can be registered even if you don’t satisfy the requirements, but for some like ‘.mil’ and ‘.edu’ you must fit the requirements.
<br><br>
<li>Second Level domains</li>
Second-level domains are below the TLDs highlighted above in terms of hierarchy. This doesn’t mean they’re any less authoritative, or valuable. examples of second level domains are 
    
    <ul>
      <li>.co.uk – Companies in the United Kingdom commonly use this.</li>
      <li>.gov.uk – This is used by government agencies throughout the United Kingdom.
      </li>
      <li>.gov.au – Government agencies across Australia use this.</li>
      </ul>
      <br><br>
       
         <li>Third level domains</li>
         The only real reason you’ll be using a third-level domain is when you’re adding a subdomain to your existing domain.
To have a fully functional domain name you don’t need to have a third-level domain name. For example,‘hostgator.com’ would function just perfectly. Even the ‘www’ that used to be a requirement of domain names is no longer necessary.
Subdomains can be used for a variety of purposes, but here are some of the most common:</h4>
    </ol>
    <ul>
     <h4> <li>Adding a blog.</h4> You can host your blog on a subdomain like ‘blog.mysite.com,’ to create a separate content hub</li>
       <h4> <li>Creating a resource section.</h4>If you have a resource, tutorial, or support section, you can host this on subdomain like ‘support.mysite.com.’</li>
       <h4> <li>Hosting an app.</h4> If you have a web-based app, you can use a subdomain like ‘app.mysite.com.’</li>
       <h4> <li>Creating an online store.</h4>Online stores require different software, programs, and security protocols. Instead of applying this to your entire site, you can use a subdomain like ‘store.mysite.com’ to run your storefront.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>KEY FACTORS TO CHOOSING A DOMAIN</h3>
      <h4>  <ol>
          <li>It Should Align With Website Goals</li>
          <li>Go for Something Common First, Fun Second</li>
          <li>Pick Up Related Extensions</li>
          </ol></h4>
<h3>DOMAIN SUFFIX</h3>
  <h5>The term "dot.com" has become a ubiquitous phrase in the English language. The "dot.com" really refers to the
  domain of a Web site. Sites on the Web are grouped by their URLs according to the type of organization providing
  the information on the site. For example, any commercial enterprise or corporation that has a Web site will have
  a domain suffix of .com, which means it is a commercial entity.
  The domain suffix provides you with a clue about the purpose or audience of a Web site. The domain suffix might
  also give you a clue about the geographic origin of a Web site. Many sites from the United Kingdom will have a
  domain suffix of .uk.
   examples are:<br>
   .com- Commercial sites.<br>
   .edu-Educational institution.<br>
   .gov-Government<br>
   .org-Traditionally a non-profit organization.<br>
   .mil-military<br>
   .net-network<br>

    <h2>THE WORLD WIDE WEB(WWW)</h2>
    <h5>World Wide Web (WWW), byname the Web, the leading information retrieval service of the Internet (the  worldwide computer network). The Web gives users access to a vast array of documents that are connected to each other by means of hypertext or hypermedia links—i.e., hyperlinks, electronic connections that link related
    pieces of information in order to allow a user easy access to them.</h5>

    <h3>WORKING ON WWW</h3>
    <h5>The World Wide Web is based on several different technologies: Web browsers, Hypertext Markup Language
    (HTML) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).<br>
    Web browsers can be defined as programs which display text, data,
    pictures, animation and video on the Internet. Hyperlinked resources on the World Wide Web can be accessed
    using software interface provided by Web browsers. Initially Web browsers were used only for surfing the Web
    but now they have become more universal. Web browsers can be used for several tasks including conducting
    searches, mailing, transferring files, and much more. Some of the commonly used browsers are Internet Explorer,
    Opera Mini, Google Chrome.<br></h5>
    <h3>FEATURES OF WWW</h3>
  <h5>  <ul>
      <li>HyperText Information System.</li>
      <li>Cross-Platform.</li>
       <li>Distributed.</li>
      <li>Open Standards and Open Source.</li>
      <li> Uses Web Browsers to provide a single interface for many services.</li>
      <li> Dynamic, Interactive and Evolving.</li></h5></ul>
      <h3>COMPONENTS OF THE WEB</h3>
      <h4>There are 3 basic components of the web
      <ol>
      <li> Uniform Resource Locator (URL): serves as system for resources on web.
      <li> HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP): specifies communication of browser and server.
     <li>  Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML): defines structure, organisation and content of webpage.</li>
     </ol></h4>
     <h4>Understanding URLS</h4>
     <h5>URL MEAN (UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR)
     Every URL begins with the scheme. This tells your browser what type of address it is so the browser connects to
     it correctly. There are many types of schemes, but for typical web browsing you will mostly see http and https.
     Your browser usually won’t show the scheme in the address bar, and usually you don’t need to type the scheme
     when typing a web address; instead, you can just begin with the domain name.</h5>
     <img src="hppt.png" width="200px" height="100px">
     
     <h4>Domain Names</h4>
    <h5>Each segment of the domain name separated by a period is called a domain. The domain on the right is called
    a top-level domain, with the domain to the left of it called the second-level domain, then third-level domain, and
    so on.</h5>
    <img src="Domain.png" width="200px" height="150px">
    
    <h4>File path, parameters, anchor</h4>
   <h5>file path tells your browser to load a specific page. If you don’t specify a path and only enter a domain name, your browser is still loading a specific page.<br>
   
   PARAMETERS it begins with a question mark The parameter string can be clear or confusing to a human user, but it is critical information for the server.<br>
   
   ANCHOR the anchor tells your browser to scroll to or load a specific part of the page. Usually the anchor begins with a hashtag and is used to direct your browser to a specific part of a very long page.<br>
   </h5>

   <h4>A WHOLE URL</h4>
   <h5>When combined, these elements make up a URL, although not all URLs will have all five parts</h5>

   <h4>SEARCHING THE INTERNET</h4>
<h5><ol>
  <li> Vary Your Search Engine</li>
  <li> Use Specific Keywords</li>
  <li> Simplify Your Search Terms</li>
  <li> Use Quotation Marks</li>
  <li> Remove Unhelpful Words</li>

  <li> Avoid Search Pitfalls </li></h5>
</ol>
<h4>KEY POINTS</h4>
  <h5>
  The internet is vast and often confusing, and in order to find what you want, you need to take some basic steps to make your
  search as focused and rewarding as possible. Strategies for pinpointing the best, most relevant content include the following:
<ul>
  <li>Vary your search engine:in fact,get
  used to using several,as they have different
  strengths.</li>
  <li>Use specific keywords:be as specific
  as you can in your wording.</li>
  <li>Use quotation marks:this narrows
  searches down to particular words and
  phrases.</li>
  <li>Remove unhelpful words:remove
  confusing or misdirecting terms from your
  searches with the-(minus) operator.</li>
  <li>Refine your search using operators:
  use operators to search specific sites,related
  sites,and particular combinations of terms.</li>
  <li>Avoid search pitfalls:the internet
  is a selling tool as well as a fantastic
  resource.Besurethatyouonlyview
  advertisements if you want to.</li>
