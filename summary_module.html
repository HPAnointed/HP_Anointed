    <h2><strong><u><center>INTERNET AND WEB TECHNOLOGIES (CTE114)</center></u></strong></h2>
    </center>
    <h2>THE INTERNET </h2>The internet is a globally connected network system facilitating worldwide communication and access to data resources through a vast collection of private, public, business, academic and government networks. It is governed by agencies like the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (or IANA) that establish universal protocols.
<h4>the Internet has grown and evolved over time to facilitate services like:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Email</li>
<li>Web-enabled audio/video conferencing services</li>
<li>Online movies and gaming</li>
<li>Data transfer/file-sharing, often through File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</li>
<li>Instant messaging</li>
<li>Internet forums</li>
<li> Social networking</li>
<li>Online shopping</li>
<li>Financial services</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Brief History of the Internet</h3>
<h3><i>sharing Resources</i></h3>
The Internet started in the 1960s as a way for government researchers to share information. Computers in the '60s were large and immobile and in order to make use of information stored in any one computer, one had to either travel to the site of the computer or have magnetic computer tapes sent through the conventional postal system.
<p>January 1, 1983 is considered the official birthday of the Internet. Prior to this, the various computer networks did not have a standard way to communicate with each other. A new communications protocol was established called Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP). This allowed different kinds of computers on different 
networks to "talk" to each other. ARPANET and the Defense Data Network officially changed to the TCP/IP 
standard on January 1, 1983, hence the birth of the Internet. All networks could now be connected by a universal language</p>
<h3>TYPES OF INTERNET PROTOCOLS</h3>
Following are categories of Internet services.
<ol>
  <li><h4>File Retrieval Protocol</h4> </li>
  <li><h4>FTP(file transfer protocol)</h4></li>
  <li><h4>Gopher</h4></li>
  <li><h4>Telnet</h4></li>
  </ol>
  <h3>COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email:</strong>This method of Internet communication has become the standard. A main computer acts as a "post office" by sending and receiving mail for those who have accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Usenet:</strong>Usenet is something like a bulletin board or an email list without the subscription. Anyone can post a message to
or browse through a Usenet newsgroup.</li>
<li><strong>IRC (Internet Relay Chat):</strong>
This protocol allows for synchronous communication: users on different computers anywhere in the world can communicate in "real time" or simultaneously.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>An Ethernet:</h4>Ethernet is the most widely installed LAN technology world.
  An ethernet is a group of technologies that enable computers and other devices to transfer data among themselves. Computers connected via Ethernet are usually located in the same apartment or building or in close proximity to each other.
<h4>Ethernet versus Internet: 4 Factors</h4>
  The Internet is a general term for computer networks, and Ethernet is a part of the Internet. Both are regarded as the network used to connect to the computer, but the scope is different.
<ul><h5>
  <li>Connection method</li>
  <li>Network type</li>
  <li>Safety and Security</li>
  <li>Control</li>
  </ul></h5>
<h5>Key Differences Internet vs Ethernet</h5>
<ol>
  <li><p>Ethernet connects nearby equipment and can have hundreds of Ethernets within a local area distance.The corresponding ones are token ring,, ATM, WLAN FDDI, Etc. LAN. Ethernet specifies the network topology, access control method, transmission rate, etc. of the local area network.</p></li>

<li><p>The Internet is the global Internet including local area networks. It uses the TCP/IP protocol cluster as the communication method, and the system structure is <strong><i>divided into 4 layers: application layer, transport layer, network layer, and network interface layer.</i></strong>Private, public, academic, commercial, or government 
networks can all be connected to each other through the Internet.</p></li>

  <li>Generally speaking, Ethernet is a small network that works at the network interface layer, while the Internet is a large network that connects various small networks <strong><em>(i.e collection of multiple LAN).</em></strong> </li>
</ol>
<h4>WORKING PRINCIPLE OF THE INTERNET AND HOW DEVICES COMMUNICATE</h4>
<p>The internet is a worldwide computer network that transmits a variety of data and media across interconnected devices.</p>
<p>When data is transferred over the internet, it’s delivered in messages and packets. Data sent over the internet is called a message, but before messages get sent, they’re broken up into tinier parts called (packets).</p>
<p>IP is a system of rules that govern how information is sent from one computer to another computer over an internet connection.</p>
